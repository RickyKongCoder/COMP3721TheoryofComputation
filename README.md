# COMP3721 TheoryofComputation
## Topics/KeyWords:

On successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:

- [x] 1.      decision problems, language recognition, computational machine (finite automata, pushdown automata, Turing machine),classes of language.

2.      (Prove) DFA, NFA, regex and the equivalence of PDA and CFG. [x]

3.      Design finite automata, write regular expressions for regular languages.

4.      Write context-free grammar (CFG) for context-free languages, especially for expressions occurring in programming languages.

5.      Design pushdown automata for context-free languages. Given a context-free grammar, construct a PDA that accepts the language generated by the given grammar.

6.      Given a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA), convert it to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

7.      Apply pumping theorem to prove that a language is not regular or not context free.

8.      Understand the Church-Turing thesis and the unsolvability of the halting problem and apply reduction technique to prove the undecidability of decision problems, in particular language recognition problems.

9.      Understand the concepts of P, NP, and NP-completeness and use reductions to prove that a given problem is NP-complete.

 
 
 Lets go :D.
